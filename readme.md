## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin to change the rank (also known
as depth or level) of headings (so `<h1>` through `<h6>`).
You can increase (by passing a positive number) or decrease (negative number)
all headings.

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**rehype** adds support for HTML to unified.
**hast** is the HTML AST that rehype uses.
This is a rehype plugin that changes headings in the tree.

## When should I use this?

This plugin is particularly useful when merging documents into each other.
For example, when injecting a `readme.md` that starts with an `<h1>` into a
site that uses an `<h1>` for the title of the website.
This plugin can be used to shift all the headings inside the readme.

This plugin is built on [`hast-util-shift-heading`][hast-util-shift-heading],
which does the work on syntax trees.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-shift-heading
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeShiftHeading from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-shift-heading@2'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeShiftHeading from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-shift-heading@2?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {rehype} from 'rehype'
import rehypeShiftHeading from 'rehype-shift-heading'

const file = await rehype()
  .data('settings', {fragment: true})
  .use(rehypeShiftHeading, {shift: 1})
  .process('<h1>Alpha!</h1>')

console.log(String(file))
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
<h2>Alpha!</h2>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`rehypeShiftHeading`][api-rehype-shift-heading].

### `unified().use(rehypeShiftHeading[, options])`

Change the rank (depth, level) of headings.

Does not shift past `h1` and `h6`.

###### Parameters

* `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
  — configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

* `shift` (`number`, default: `0`)
  — number to shift headings; can be negative to decrease heading levels

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `rehype-shift-heading@^2`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

This plugin works with `rehype-parse` version 1+, `rehype-stringify` version 1+,
`rehype` version 1+, and `unified` version 4+.

## Security

Use of `rehype-shift-heading` is safe.
